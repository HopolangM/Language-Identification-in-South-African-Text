# Language-Identification-in-South-African-Text

This repository contains the code for my solution to the Language Identification Challenge on Kaggle. The challenge involves classifying text written in South Africa's 11 Official languages. The notebook includes sections covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission generation. By leveraging various machine learning techniques, the goal is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the language of a given text.
